      This sample appears to be compiled with AutoIt.

      AutoIt is a freeware BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI.
      capa cannot handle AutoIt scripts. This means that the results will be misleading or incomplete.
      You may have to analyze the file manually, using a tool like the AutoIt decompiler MyAut2Exe.
